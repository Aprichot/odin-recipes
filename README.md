# odin-recipes 

This project focuses on putting my newly acquired HTML skills to use. To create a basic recipe website, this project will use lists, links, and images. I will demonstrate that I can use a basic Git workflow to manage my projects. I will make it a habit to commit my changes using the command line to push to Git. Not only will I become more comfortable using Git to manage my project, but I'll also become more familiar with the command line in general. 

Post project reflection:
