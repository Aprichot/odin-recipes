    <p class="text">You walk into a house and begin rummaging through the owner's personal belongings as the owner of the house stands awkwardly off to the side. 
                    You don't pay much attention to them. They watch you leave with a box of Blamco Mac & Cheese that they spent the last two months saving up to buy. Finders keepers!

    <h3 class="header">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul id="ingredients">
        <li>1 pound elbow macaroni, cooked</li>
        <li>2 medium carrots, chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground mustard</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>8 ounces sharp cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>4 ounces fontina cheese, shredded</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
    <ol id="ingredients">
        <li>Fill a medium pot with water and bring to a boil. Add the carrots, cover, reduce the heat to medium,
            and simmer for 5 minutes, or until the carrots are tender. Drain and transfer the carrrots into a blender.
            Add the milk, heavy cream, and Worcestershire sauce. Blend until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the flour, ground mustard, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a
            small bowl. Place a large saucepan over a medium-high heat and add the butter.
            Once melted, add the spiced flour while contantly whisking. After the butter and
            flour have combined intoa roux, slowly whisk in the carrot and milk mixture until
            fully combined.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk in the cheddar and fontina cheese in small batches. Season with salt and pepper. Add the cooked macaroni
            to the cheese sauce and stir with salt and pepper. Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce
            and stir to coat the macaroni fully.
        </li>
    </ol>
