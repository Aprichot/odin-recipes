        <h3 class="header">Steps</h3>
        <h5 class="section">To Make the Cheesecake</h5>
        <ol id="ingredients">
            <li>Preheat the oven to 275Â°F. Combine the heavy cream and the scraped vanilla bean in a
                small bowl and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the cream cheese until smooth.
                You will need to scrape down the sides a few times to make sure all of the cream cheese
                is completely smooth. Add the sugar and mix well. Next, add the eggs one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the vanilla bean from the heavy cream. Pour the heavy cream, sour cream, salt, cornstarch, and vanilla extract
                into the cream cheese mixture. Mix well and scrape the sides to incorporate everything
                completely. 
            </li>
            <li>Wrap the outside of a 9-inch springform pan in aluminum foil. This will prevent any water from
                entering the pan. Butter the inside of the pan. Carefully line the pan with parchment paper. All of these steps
                will prevent the cheesecake from sticking, making it easier to remove from the pan.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the pan and rap the pan against the counter several times to remove air 
                bubbles. Place the cake pan in a large, deep baking tray. Pour hot water in the baking tray 
                until it is about halfway up on the cake pan. This is doen to avoid harshly cooking the cake 
                and to prevent cracks from forming on the top. Bake for 1 hour, until set.
            </li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and keep the cheesecake in the oven for another hour. This allows the cheesecake to finish cooking inside without cracking the top.
                Remove from the oven and the deep baking pan and cool to room temperature, then refrigerate for at least 4 hours (overnight is best).
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h5 class="section">To Make the Topping</h5>
        <ol id="ingredients">
            <li>Place the strawberries in a blender in a blender and puree until smooth. Pour the pureed strawberries
                through a mesh strainer to remove the seeds. Place into a large saucepan with the cinnamon stick over medium-high heat. 
                Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and add the sugar, vanilla extract, and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>In a small bowl combine the cornstarch and water. Remove the cinnamon stick and add the cornstarch
                slurry to the saucepan and whisk until it has slightly thickened. Allow to cool and then cover and place in the 
                refrigerator. The sauce will fully thicken as it cools, so allow it to refrigerate for at least 2 hours (overnight is best).
            </li>
            </ol>
            <h5 class="section">For Assembly</h5>
            <ol id="ingredients">
                <li>Slice a piece of the cheesecake and drizzle with the strawberry sauce. Place the caramel buttercream into a pastry bag witha  closed star tip.
                     Place a small dollop of caramel buttercream on top of the sliced cheesecake.
                </li>
                </ol>
